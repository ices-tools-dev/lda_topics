## 11 Oct Skype meeting

Arni, Carlos, Shaheen

**Points raised**

1. Diverse ICES reports go back to 1902 and the digitization seems to be of high
   quality (faithful copy-paste into text editor).

2. LDA does not look at time as a variable. To analyze trends or compare topics
   between periods, one could either analyze them separately and compare
   afterwards, or consider using *dynamic topic models*.

**Action items**

- Prepare and make available a PDF collection for initial analysis, starting
  around the year 2000. [Carlos]

- Analyze the first PDF collection using LDA. [Shaheen]

*[ ] Present initial results. [Shaheen]

- Discuss initial results. [Arni, Carlos, Shaheen]

- Examine which PDF reports are administrative or duplicated material. [Arni]

- Write a script that removes PDF files to narrow down to scientific reports.
  [Arni]

- Prepare a GitHub repository to coordinate the work. [Arni]
